Hi everyone, thank you for getting one of my first scripts!

If you have any problems with this, (through credits or anything else) please contact me on discord at: Swan#2366

To change the colors go to "progressBar.html" file and update the following:
=> line 64 to change the background color. !!!! NOT THE BACKGROUND COMPLETATION LINE. NOR THE USUAL BACKGROUND.
=> line 65 to change the time background color.
=> line 66 to change the text colour.

!!!!!! DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING FROM client.lua FOR THIS TO WORK !!!!!!

when the program is used, the resmon stays at 0.00.
when the program isn't used, the resmon syats at 0.00.
